                <h4>Location</h4>
                <p>Luxor, home to one-third of the world’s monuments, often referred to as the “world’s greatest open-air museum,” is a city on the east bank of the Nile River in southern Egypt. It was once the ancient city of Thebes, the capital of Egypt during the New Kingdom period, and is home to some of the most magnificent monuments of ancient Egypt. Luxor is divided into two main areas: the East Bank, where the city and temples of Karnak and Luxor are located, and the West Bank, where the Valley of the Kings, Valley of the Queens, and the mortuary temples of the pharaohs can be found.</p>

                <h4>How to Get There</h4>
                <p>Luxor International Airport (LXR) is the main gateway to the city, with direct flights from Cairo and several international destinations. From Cairo, you can also take an overnight train or a Nile cruise, which offers a scenic and leisurely way to reach Luxor. Once in Luxor, taxis, horse-drawn carriages, and bicycles are popular modes of transportation for exploring the city and its surrounding monuments.</p>

                <h4>Best Time to Go/Weather</h4>
                <p>The best time to visit Luxor is during the cooler months, from October to April. During this period, temperatures are more moderate, ranging from 20°C to 30°C (68°F to 86°F), making it ideal for exploring the outdoor sites. The summer months (May to September) can be extremely hot, with temperatures often exceeding 40°C (104°F), which can make sightseeing uncomfortable, especially in the exposed desert areas of the West Bank.</p>
